            <p>This is a progressive brain disorder that gradually deteriorates memory, cognitive abilities, and the ability to perform everyday tasks. It is the most common cause of dementia, affecting millions of people worldwide. Alzheimer's primarily impacts older adults but can also affect people under 65 in what is known as early-onset Alzheimer's.</p>
